### Rhythm Generator

A new rhythmic generator prototype: [christoffel rhythm generator](https://visualex.github.io/rhythms/christoffel.html)

This will be ported to VST and (hopefully) to a hardware version :)

### Noisy - folded distortion

[Download 3.9MB](https://tresorg.com/vst/Noisy.vst3.zip)

VST3 and Mac only for now. This is donation-ware, please support development if you use this in your productions, or you would like to see features get implemented.

Usage: the higher the volume of the input, more folded is the resulting waveform. Tips: use parallel processing, pre/post filtering and reverb.

Demo video coming soon.

[Feature requests](https://github.com/tresorg/tresorg.github.io/issues) are welcome!
