                <h3>Architectural Consulting</h3>
                <p>
                    Tresorg specializes in modernizing systems and designing architectures that scale.
                    We provide monolith rescue strategies, modularization roadmaps, event-driven architectures,
                    and technical due diligence for investors and acquisitions. Scale from MVP to enterprise without collapsing under load.
                    We set up development processes for growing teams, introduce Continuous Integration and quality gates,
                    and help founders make critical technical decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                   We build architectures designed to evolve, not be rewritten.

                <h3>Software Quality & Engineering Practices</h3>
                <p>
                    From codebase audits to establishing clean architecture, Tresorg helps teams improve code quality,
                    developer workflows, and system observability. We focus on refactoring strategies, testing,
                    pipelines and helping you get the right logging, tracing, and metrics.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Your teams will deliver predictably by introducing and improving appropriate practices,
                    fixing planning and retrospectives, and identifying organizational bottlenecks. We mentor engineering
                    leads and help establish development cycles that actually work.
                </p>

                    or providing fractional CTO services, Tresorg enables teams to grow. We help build technical
                    career ladders, improve cross-team collaboration, and create engineers that guide sustainable growth.
